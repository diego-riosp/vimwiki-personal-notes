[Back](index.md)

### Titles
1. Main title `#`
2. Secundary title `##`
3. Third title `###`
4. And so on (up to six-`#`)

### Items
1. no-numbered items with `-` at beginning, or `*`
2. numbered items with `1.`, `2.`, `3.`, etc.
3. sub-items with indent below an item.

### Text style
1. *Italic text* with `*` enclosing.
2. **Strong** text with `**` enclosing.
3. ~~Strikethrough~~ text with `~~` enclosing.

### Links
Use syntaxis `[explicit](impicit)` where `explicit` refers to showed text and `implicit` is the path where you expect go by clicking the explicit text.

### Cites
Use `>` at beginning in order to emphasize text as cite.

### Horizontal line
Use `---` or `___` to add a horizontal line.

### Code blocks
To generate code blocks, the text in-line must be enclosed between ` `` `, or text out-line enclosed in ` ```language-name   ``` `

Tables
1. Vertical spacements with `|`.
2. Horizontal lines with `----------`

As an exmple: 
```markdown
| column 1   | column 2  | column 3 |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| text 1     | text 2    | text 3   |
| text 4     | text 5    | text 6   |
```
Generates the following table: 

| column 1   | column 2  | column 3 |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| text 1     | text 2    | text 3   |
| text 4     | text 5    | text 6   |

### Images
Use the syntaxis `![explicit](implicit "image title")` where `explicit` shows the text for image and `implicit` is the image path.

### GitHub Markdown
1. TO-DO list with `<star> <open bracket><close bracket>`, and `<star> <open bracket> X <close bracket>` for check task.  
2. Put emojis with `:emoji-name:`. For a complete list of emojis, visit [GitHub emoji list](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).
